# Prediction of Total Knee Replacement and Diagnosis of Osteoarthritis using Deep Learning: Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative/ GM Hospital

## Introduction
This repo contains implementation of the deep learning-based outcome prediction model used for osteoarthritis research as described in our paper: [........................................................................................................................] . By using this implementation, you can either train new models using nested cross-validation or obtain TKR outcome and KL grade redictions by using our pretrained models.[>>>> Model link will be given soon <<<<]

                                -|- Papers

* Methodology diagram

* Main python notebook file which make all the predictions and calculate results.

* Requirements.txt which contains all the required python library.

## Training a DL model
You can use this repo to train models for predicting TKR outcome and KL grade. So, you directly run the following script to train DL models with nested cross-validation. 

## Inference

--- Inference Results ---
Total Knee Replacement (TKR): 0.86
Minimal  0: 0.47
Healthy  1: 0.41
Moderate 2: 0.40
Doubtful 3: 0.78
Severe   4: 0.83
