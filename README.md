# Knee-Replacement-Using-Deep-Learning

By seaching over the internet I found there is a common relation between **The Knee Replacement and The Knee Osteoarthritis**.
If the **Severity is 0 or 1 then there is no need of replacement and if the Severity is greater than 2 then there is a change of the replacement**.

I am thing to make use of **Object Detection** for this work.
